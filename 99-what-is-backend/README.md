### What is backend

- backend is relative things.
- if I print hello world in terminal, terminal is the frontend of mine, and the logic, functionality behind the hello world print is backend.
- who are build express, they are backend, and when I build rest api with express, I use the frontend of express.
- Any code that runs in a computer is backend. If you can solve a problem by writing a piece of code you are backend developer.

### Our Goal & Expectation

- Beyond any other course available on the planet for Backend.
- Create any backend application (less focus on programming)
- Create any backend application that
  - high performant
  - fault tolerant
  - easy to deploy
  - scalable
  - secure

### Skills an experienced senior backend engineer mush have

An experienced senior backend engineer should have a broad range of technical skills, as well as strong soft skills that enable them to lead and mentor others effectively. Here are some of the key skills that an experienced senior backend engineer should have:

1. Expertise in Backend Technologies: An experienced senior backend engineer should have deep knowledge of backend technologies such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, and databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. They should have a good understanding of how these technologies work and how to use them effectively.
2. System Design and Architecture: An experienced senior backend engineer should have strong understanding of system design and architecture principles. They should be able to design and implement scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems that meet business requirements.
3. API Design and Development: An experienced senior backend engineer should be skilled in designing and developing APIs using REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. They should have a good understanding of API security, versioning, documentation, and testing.
4. Performance Optimization: An experienced senior backend engineer should have extensive experience optimizing application performance through techniques such as caching, load balancing, and database tuning. They should be able to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize code accordingly.
5. DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): An experienced senior backend engineer should be familiar with DevOps principles and practices, including containerization, deployment automation, and monitoring. They should have extensive experience setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
6. Leadership and Mentoring: An experienced senior backend engineer should have strong leadership and mentoring skills. They should be able to guide and mentor junior and mid-level developers, as well as collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.
7. Communication and Collaboration: An experienced senior backend engineer should have excellent communication and collaboration skills. They should be able to communicate technical concepts to no-technical stakeholders, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and lead code review and team meetings.
8. Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking: An experienced senior backend engineer should be a strong problem solver and critical thinker. They should be able to analyze complex problems, identify root causes, and propose effective solutions.
9. Data Modeling and Database Engineering: An experienced senior backed engineer should have expertise in data modeling and database engineering. They should be able to design efficient database schemas, optimize queries, and manage database backups and restores.
10. Security and Compliance: An experienced senior backend engineer should have extensive experience designing and implementing secure systems that meet compliance requirements. They should be familiar with best practices for data encryption, access control, and vulnerability management.

Overall, and experienced senior backend engineer should have a broad range of technical skills and strong soft skills that enable them to design, build, and maintain complex backend systems that meet business requirements. They should have a deep understanding of backend technologies, system design and architecture principles, API design and development, performance optimization, DevOps and CI/CD practices, leadership and mentoring, communication and collaboration, problem-solving and critical thinking, data modeling and database engineering, and security and compliance.
