### What is backend

- backend is relative things.
- if I print hello world in terminal, terminal is the frontend of mine, and the logic, functionality behind the hello world print is backend.
- who are build express, they are backend, and when I build rest api with express, I use the frontend of express.
- Any code that runs in a computer is backend. If you can solve a problem by writing a piece of code you are backend developer.

### Our Goal & Expectation

- Beyond any other course available on the planet for Backend.
- Create any backend application (less focus on programming)
- Create any backend application that
  - high performant
  - fault tolerant
  - easy to deploy
  - scalable
  - secure

### Skills an experienced senior backend engineer mush have

An experienced senior backend engineer should have a broad range of technical skills, as well as strong soft skills that enable them to lead and mentor others effectively. Here are some of the key skills that an experienced senior backend engineer should have:

1. Expertise in Backend Technologies: An experienced senior backend engineer should have deep knowledge of backend technologies such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, and databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. They should have a good understanding of how these technologies work and how to use them effectively.
2. System Design and Architecture: An experienced senior backend engineer should have strong understanding of system design and architecture principles. They should be able to design and implement scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems that meet business requirements.
